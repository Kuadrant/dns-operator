## Overview

CoreDNS integration enables DNS Operator to manage DNS records using a self-hosted CoreDNS instance running in Kubernetes, providing an alternative to cloud-managed DNS services (AWS Route53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS).

> CoreDNS integration can be removed by deleting the CoreDNS deployment and switching DNSPolicies to use a different DNS provider. To migrate to a different provider, delete existing DNSRecords and recreate them with the new provider secret reference. No data is permanently locked into CoreDNS.

### Is This for You?

Consider CoreDNS integration if you:
- Need to avoid dependency on external cloud DNS services
- Operate in environments with no internet access or restricted network connectivity
- Have regulatory or compliance requirements mandating self-hosted infrastructure
- Want to delegate specific DNS zones from existing DNS servers (BIND, Unbound, or cloud DNS) to Kubernetes-managed CoreDNS
- Require consistent DNS management across hybrid or multi-cloud environments
- Need to reduce DNS operational costs by eliminating per-query charges

Cloud DNS providers might be a simpler choice if you are running exclusively in cloud environments and none of these scenarios apply.

**Audience**: Platform engineers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators deploying DNS infrastructure.

> **Kuadrant-operator documentation**: For Kuadrant-specific documentation including DNS delegation, DNSPolicy user guides, and deployment walkthroughs, see the [kuadrant-operator user guides](https://github.com/Kuadrant/kuadrant-operator/tree/main/doc/user-guides).

## Purpose and Use Cases

Using CoreDNS integration, you can self-manage your DNS infrastructure in Kubernetes environments. Organizations choose CoreDNS integration to maintain full control over their DNS records, meet regulatory compliance requirements, avoid cloud provider dependencies, or integrate with existing DNS infrastructure through zone delegation.

### How It Works

Unlike cloud DNS providers where a DNS Operator "pushes" records through API calls, CoreDNS integration works through a Kubernetes-native **label-based watch mechanism**:

1. **DNS Operator processes DNSRecords**
2. **DNS Operator adds a label** `kuadrant.io/coredns-zone-name: <zone>` to processed DNSRecords
3. **CoreDNS plugin watches** for DNSRecords with this label via Kubernetes API
4. **CoreDNS serves the records** it discovers through the watch

**The label is what activates CoreDNS integration**, not a provider secret or API call. This design allows CoreDNS to remain a passive observer of Kubernetes resources while DNS Operator handles the orchestration logic.

### Primary Use Cases

#### Self-Hosted Infrastructure

Organizations that require full control over their DNS infrastructure without relying on external cloud services.

**Scenarios**:
- **On-Premise Deployments**: Running Kubernetes clusters in your own data centers or colocation facilities
- **Cost Optimization**: Eliminating per-query or per-zone costs from cloud DNS services
- **Complete Ownership**: Maintaining full control over DNS data and infrastructure

**Key Benefits**:
- Complete ownership and control of DNS records
- No external service dependencies
- Reduced latency for local queries
- Integration with existing data center infrastructure
- Lower operational costs for DNS services

#### Restricted and Isolated Environments

Deployments where external connectivity is limited, prohibited, or subject to strict compliance requirements.

**Scenarios**:
- **Air-Gapped Networks**: Completely disconnected environments with no external internet access
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Government, defense, financial, or healthcare sectors with mandatory network isolation
- **Data Sovereignty**: Requirements to keep DNS data within specific geographic or organizational boundaries
- **Security-Critical Systems**: Highly sensitive environments requiring complete audit trails and access control
- **Development/Test Isolation**: Isolated environments that mirror production security constraints

**Key Benefits**:
- Fully self-contained DNS infrastructure
- Meets security and compliance mandates
- No external network dependencies
- Complete audit trails within controlled boundaries
- Reduced attack surface by eliminating external services

#### Zone Delegation from Edge DNS Servers

Integration with existing DNS infrastructure by delegating specific zones to CoreDNS while maintaining authoritative control at the edge.

**Scenario**:
- **Edge DNS Integration**: Delegate application-specific subdomains (e.g., `apps.example.com`) from your authoritative DNS servers (BIND, Unbound, or cloud DNS providers like Route53, Cloud DNS, Azure DNS) to CoreDNS

**Key Benefits**:
- Seamless integration with existing DNS infrastructure (self-hosted or cloud-based)
- Preserve existing DNS operations and processes
- Maintain edge DNS security controls and governance
- Flexible deployment without replacing entire DNS infrastructure

## Infrastructure Requirements

### CoreDNS Infrastructure

For CoreDNS infrastructure requirements (resource limits, storage, networking, etc.), see the [CoreDNS scaling guide](https://github.com/coredns/deployment/blob/master/kubernetes/Scaling_CoreDNS.md).

### DNS Operator Integration Requirements

**Minimum Kubernetes Version**: 1.19.0 or higher

**Cluster Architecture**:
- **Single Cluster**: One Kubernetes cluster running CoreDNS and DNS Operator
- **Multi-Cluster**: Multiple clusters with different roles:
  - **Primary Clusters**: Run CoreDNS instance and DNS Operator in primary mode
  - **Secondary Clusters**: Run DNS Operator only in secondary mode (no CoreDNS deployment needed)

**RBAC Permissions**:

CoreDNS pods require Kubernetes API permissions to watch DNSRecord resources:
- **DNSRecord resources** (`kuadrant.io` API group): `get`, `list`, `watch` permissions
- **Scope**: Configured with the `WATCH_NAMESPACES` environment variable (empty = all namespaces, which is the default)

### Multi-Cluster Requirements

For multi-cluster delegation scenarios:

**Network Connectivity**:

Primary clusters must have network connectivity to secondary cluster Kubernetes APIs. Required for synchronizing DNSRecord status across clusters

**Cluster Interconnection Secrets**:

Primary clusters require kubeconfig interconnection secrets for all other clusters (primary and secondary):
- The secret must be created using the `kubectl-kuadrant_dns add-cluster-secret` command (from the `dns-operator` CLI, which must be installed separately - see [CLI documentation](../cli.md))
- Labeled with `kuadrant.io/multicluster-kubeconfig=true`
- Stored in `dns-operator-system` namespace

**DNS Operator Configuration**:
- Primary clusters: `--delegation-role=primary` (default)
- Secondary clusters: `--delegation-role=secondary`

For complete details, see the DNS Record Delegation documentation in the kuadrant-operator repository

## Deploying CoreDNS

> When DNS Operator is using CoreDNS, it can do so in both single-cluster and multi-cluster settings. However, **for multi-cluster environments, the Delegation feature is required**. Cloud DNS providers can operate in multi-cluster mode with or without delegation, but CoreDNS specifically requires delegation for multi-cluster coordination. See the DNS Record Delegation documentation in the kuadrant-operator repository for complete details.

### Deployment Architectures

**Single Cluster Deployment**:

A standalone deployment where all CoreDNS components run in a single Kubernetes cluster. Suitable for development, testing, or standalone deployments. No delegation required.

**What Gets Deployed:**
- CoreDNS instance (with Kuadrant plugin) - serves DNS queries
- DNS Operator - reconciles DNSRecords

**Multi-Cluster Deployment**:

Multi-cluster deployments use the delegation feature to coordinate DNS records across clusters. For complete details on how delegation works, see the DNS Record Delegation documentation in the kuadrant-operator repository.

**What Gets Deployed:**

- **Primary Clusters**:
  - CoreDNS instance - serves DNS queries
  - DNS Operator in primary mode (`--delegation-role=primary`)

- **Secondary Clusters**:
  - DNS Operator only in secondary mode (`--delegation-role=secondary`)
  - No CoreDNS deployment needed

### Deployment Guides

Follow the step-by-step deployment guides for your scenario:

**Local Environment**:
- [Single Cluster Setup](local-development.md#setup-single-cluster-local-environment-kind) - Deploy to a local cluster for development and testing
- [Multi-Cluster Setup](local-development.md#setup-multi-cluster-local-environment-kind) - Deploy to multiple local clusters with delegation

### Next Steps

After deploying CoreDNS:
- For configuration details (Corefile, provider secrets, monitoring, logging, etc.), see [Configuring CoreDNS](#configuring-coredns)
- For verification procedures, see [Testing the Deployment](#testing-the-deployment)

---

## Configuring CoreDNS

CoreDNS configuration consists of two main components:

1. **Corefile**: Defines zones, plugins, and DNS server behavior
2. **Provider Secrets**: Enable DNS Operator to coordinate zone matching with CoreDNS

### Core Configuration

**Corefile**:
- Zone definitions matching the zones CoreDNS serves with plugin directives and configuration
- Essential plugin: `kuadrant`

**Provider Secrets**:
- **Non-delegating DNSRecords** require a CoreDNS provider secret reference (with the `providerRef` or default provider label) for DNS Operator to add the zone label
- **Delegating DNSRecords** do not require provider secrets themselves, but they cause authoritative DNSRecords to be created on primary clusters, which **do require provider secrets**

**Zone Coordination**:
Zones must be listed in both the Corefile and provider secret `ZONES` fields to ensure that the zones CoreDNS and DNS Operator manage are specified.

### Optional Configuration

- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards
- **Logging**: Debug, error, and query logging

### Configuration Reference

For complete technical details, see **[CoreDNS Configuration Reference](configuration.md)**

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying and configuring CoreDNS, verify that the integration is functioning correctly by testing DNS resolution, zone transfers, and advanced routing features.

### Verification Procedures

The deployment guides include comprehensive verification procedures for testing CoreDNS functionality:

**Local Environment**:
- [Single Cluster Verification](local-development.md#verify) - Verify single cluster deployment
- [Multi-Cluster Verification](local-development.md#verify-1) - Verify multi-cluster deployment
- [GEO Routing Verification](local-development.md#geo) - Test geographic routing

### Troubleshooting

**Records not appearing in DNS queries**:
1. Verify DNSRecord has the `kuadrant.io/coredns-zone-name` label - DNS Operator adds this when processing the record
2. Check the zone in the label matches a zone defined in your Corefile
3. Review CoreDNS logs for watch errors or plugin issues
4. Confirm that CoreDNS has RBAC permissions to watch DNSRecords in the target namespace

**Geo-routing not working**:
1. Ensure `geoip` and `metadata` plugins are enabled in your Corefile
2. Verify GeoIP database path in Corefile matches the mounted database location
3. Enable debug logging in Corefile and review logs for GeoIP lookup failures

**Multi-cluster coordination issues**:
1. For delegation issues, see the DNS Record Delegation documentation in the kuadrant-operator repository
2. Verify kubeconfig secrets exist and are correctly labeled on primary clusters
3. Check DNS Operator logs on both primary and secondary clusters for reconciliation errors
4. Confirm network connectivity between clusters (primary clusters must reach secondary cluster APIs)

## Advanced Configuration: Configuring an Edge Server

This section covers **zone delegation** - an advanced configuration for integrating CoreDNS with existing DNS infrastructure. Zone delegation allows you to maintain your existing authoritative DNS servers while delegating specific subdomains to CoreDNS running in Kubernetes.

> Zone delegation is **optional**. If you're running CoreDNS as your primary DNS infrastructure without integrating with existing DNS servers, you can skip this section.

### What is Zone Delegation?

Zone delegation is a DNS mechanism where an authoritative DNS server delegates responsibility for a subdomain to another set of nameservers. This creates a hierarchical DNS structure where:

1. **Parent Zone** (e.g., `example.com`) is managed by an authoritative edge server (BIND9, cloud DNS, etc.)
2. **Delegated Zone** (e.g., `k.example.com`) is delegated to CoreDNS instances running in Kubernetes
3. **Delegation Records** (NS and glue A records) in the parent zone point to the CoreDNS nameservers

**Why Use Zone Delegation?**

- **Production DNS Hierarchy**: Maintain your existing authoritative DNS while delegating application zones to Kubernetes
- **Organizational Control**: Keep root domains managed by existing DNS infrastructure and processes
- **Isolation**: Separate Kubernetes-managed DNS from corporate DNS infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Change Kubernetes DNS infrastructure without affecting root domain configuration

**Common Scenarios**:
- Delegate `apps.example.com` from Bind9-managed `example.com` to CoreDNS
- Delegate internal zones from cloud DNS (Route53, Cloud DNS) to on-premise CoreDNS
- Create test/staging zones delegated to development CoreDNS instances

### Implementation Guide

For step-by-step instructions on configuring zone delegation with Bind9, see:
- **[Zone Delegation Guide](zone-delegation.md)** - Complete guide for setting up Bind9 delegation

**What the guide covers**:
- Configuring Bind9 (deployed with `make local-setup` command) to delegate zones to CoreDNS
- Creating NS and glue A records for delegation using `nsupdate`
- Configuring cluster CoreDNS to forward queries to the edge server
- Setting up rewrite rules in `kuadrant-coredns` for active groups queries
- Verification procedures

**Production Adaptations**:
- If using an existing Bind9 server (not in Kubernetes), adapt the `nsupdate` commands to target your server
- For cloud DNS providers (Route53, Cloud DNS, Azure DNS), create NS records via their web console or API
- Ensure proper network connectivity between your edge DNS and CoreDNS LoadBalancer IPs
- Consider DNSSEC if your root zone uses it
- Implement monitoring for delegation chain health
